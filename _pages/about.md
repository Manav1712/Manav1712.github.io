Hi! My name is Manav Jairam. I am a senior at the University of California, San Diego majoring in Data Science. I also have a keen interest in Entreprenership and Innovation, which is my minor!

I have a broad interest in Natural Language Processing, Operations Research and its applications in finance, and Recommender Systems. Specifically, I have experience in conducting research, working as a Data Scientist, managing various aspects of the Data Science project pipeline, and developing front-end applications.

I also love playing pool, running and going to concerts!
